# DLL_Design

Implemented the traditional architecture of Delay Locked Loop across PVT (Process, Voltage, Temperature) variations.
This include the following specifications:

- Designed a Voltage-Controlled Delay Line with frequency range of 427 to 813 MHz across control voltage of 0.4 to
1.4V
• Modified the conventional architecture of Phase Frequency Detector to avoid harmonic/false locking
- Designed a drain-switched charge pump biased at 1 μA
• Simulated transient response across corners to obtain worst case static phase offset of 16 ps and power consumtion of
4.8 mW
